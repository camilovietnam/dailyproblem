# Sorted Squares
## Problem description:

```
This problem was asked by Google.
Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.
For example, given [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3], return [0, 4, 4, 9, 81].
```

This is my first daily problem solved with Svelte. I think I will try to introduce a UI for all of the daily problems, just in the interest of learning more about Frontend technologies.

## How to run:
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Enable TypeScript with `node scripts/setupTypeScript.js`
- Run the web server with `npm run dev`. The app can be visited at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
