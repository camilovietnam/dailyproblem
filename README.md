# Daily Problem Repository
---

This is a public repository I have created to store the solutions, in different programming languages, to the challenges posted in the newsletter https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

It is extremely important to practice every day, even small exercises that take 20 or 30 minutes. I try to carry over this principle to everything I do. Languages (which I practice daily with Duolingo), exercise (doing 10 to 20 minutes of jumping jacks/stretching every day) and of course, programming.

This repository was created on: July 10, 2020. Just because I don't add a new solution everyday does it mean you should also be lazy. What are you doing reading this? Go program something!
